## Bluetooth Controlled Car
This project showcases a Bluetooth-controlled car using an Arduino. The car can be controlled via a smartphone or any Bluetooth-enabled device. It supports basic movements such as moving forward, backward, and turning left or right. The car's motors are controlled based on signals received through Bluetooth, enabling smooth and responsive control.

Features
Bluetooth Connectivity: Control the car wirelessly via Bluetooth.
Responsive Controls: Supports forward, backward, left, and right movements.
Arduino-Based: Built using Arduino, making it easy to modify and expand.
Real-Time Control: Uses analogWrite for precise motor speed control.
Components
Arduino Board
Bluetooth Module (e.g., HC-05)
Motor Driver (e.g., L298N)
DC Motors
Power Supply
Chassis and Wheels
Getting Started
Hardware Setup: Connect the components as described in the schematic.
Upload Code: Upload the provided Arduino code to your board.
Pair Bluetooth: Pair your Bluetooth device with the module.
Control: Use a Bluetooth controller app to send commands and control the car.
